# Advent of Code

The advent of code is a yearly code challenge that has been running since 2015. Each year challenges are released every day through December from the 1st to the 25th[^1]. Each one brings a new coding challenge to work on and post.

## Great Practice

While it's fun to get into the spirit every December, it is also just great practice. So most of these will get worked on outside of their designated year as you can go back and see every challenge released since the initial one in 2015.

## How to Join

If you would also like to participate in the Advent of Code challenge you can visit [the Advent of Code site](https://www.adventofcode.com) and join for free. The challenges and system are all free, but you can support the dev if you would like.

[^1]: Recent changes for the year 2025 will mean only 12 challenges will be released in December going forward as the dev needs a break since they've been doing this for so long.
